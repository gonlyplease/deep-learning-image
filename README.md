# Deep Learning for Image

## Overview

The main goal of this exercise is to get a feeling and understanding on the importance of representation and extraction of information from complex media content, in this case images. 

1. Start Simple with Colour Histograms
2. Explore Key Point-Based Feature Extraction
    - Explore Key Point-Based Feature Extraction: Once you’re comfortable with simple features, try using SIFT for key point detection and descriptor extraction. SIFT is robust to scale and rotation, which makes it ideal for finding distinctive features in images.
        - Visual Bag of Words: After extracting SIFT features, apply a bag-of-words approach to cluster these descriptors into visual “words.” This converts a variable number of key points into a fixed-length feature vector suitable for classifiers.


Use Python along with libraries like OpenCV (for image processing), scikit-learn (for machine learning), and possibly NumPy and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.




2. Then, try to use deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (for images) or recurrent neural networks (for text), or other approaches (but likely not just simple MLPs), and see
how your performance differs. Try at
